Dear Client,

Thank you for bringing to our attention the recent downtime you experienced on your connection. I understand that you are frustrated with the turnaround time to resolve the issue. We do not have a service level agreement that guarantees 100% uptime, and our service is best effort.

Please note that when you signed the contract with us, it was agreed that we provide a best effort service. We strive to provide the best service possible, but sometimes, unforeseen circumstances arise that may cause downtime.

To minimize any future disruptions, I suggest that you consider installing a backup connection from a different provider. This will provide you with a failover in case of any downtime, ensuring that you have access to the internet at all times.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding in this matter. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for choosing our services.

Best regards,
